# Event TCPServer Library
Thi is an event based TCP Server. This server do not use async I/O yet or LibEvent. I wrote this code to be compiled in a system that does't support LibEvent.

# Using
To Use this library, you can copy the .cpp and .h files to your project or add this repository as a submodule of your project.

# Where is the main.cpp?
This project is a library, so I don't provide a main file to test it. Instead, I wrote a projet to do unity tests in the classes and function.
You can enter in the folder 'tests' and run the command 'make all'. After run this command, a file located in tests/build, named 'tests', will
be generated. This file (tests/build/tests) is a binary file that run some tests. 

Along with this code, there is a ".vscode" folder that contains some configurations for the Visual Studio Code. If you use VSCode, you can compile the tests program direclty from the 'Debug' section of this IDE.

# dependencies
This library depends of a thread pool libraty, that was written by me. If you make a recursive git clone of this project, you shouldn't have problema with this dependency. But if you choose to clone allow the repository, you should also clone this thread pool library and adjust the include int the 'TCPServer.h' file.

The trhead pool library is in: https://github.com/rafinhatonello/ThreadPool

# Using

See some examples of how you can use this library.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "libs/TCPServer/sources/TCPServer.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace TCPServerLib;
void startMyServer(){

    //starts the server
    TCPServer server(5000);

    //you can also specify a list of ports to the server listen:
    //  TCPServer server({5000, 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004});



    //add an event (a lambda function) to know when clients connects or
    //disconnects from your server
    server.addConEventListeners([](ClientInfo *client, CONN_EVENT event){
        if (event == CONN_EVENT::CONNECTED)
            cout << "A client was connect in the server" << endl;
        else
            cout << "A client was disconnect in the server" << endl;
    });

    //add an event to be called when some data cames from the client
    server.addReceiveListener([&server](ClientInfo* client, char* data, size_t size){
        cout << "Received from client "<< string(data, size) << endl;

        //send a response to the client
        string msg = "OK, I received your data";
        server.send(client, msg.c_str(), msg.size());

        //you can also use directly the client object to send the response
        client->send(msg.c_str(), msg.size());
    });

    //add an event to be called when some data cames from the client. Is
    //very similiar to addReceiveListener method, but this receives the
    //data as a string
    //
    //OBS: addReceiveListener_s is executed after addReceiveListener (both
    // on the ClientInfo and TCPServer objects)
    server.addReceiveListener_s([](ClientInfo* client, string data){
        cout << "Received from client "<< data << endl;

        //you can also send a response as a string to the client
        server.sendString(client, "OK, I received your data");

        //again: you can also use directly the client object to send the response
        client->sendString(client, "OK, I received your data");

        //you can disconnect your client:
        server.disconnect(client);
    });
}
```

Bellow, you can see an example using directly the ClientInfo object, and user the TCPServer object just to handle the incoming clients

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "libs/TCPServer/sources/TCPServer.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace TCPServerLib;
void startMyServer(){

    //starts the server
    TCPServer server({5000, 5001});



    //add an event (a lambda function) to know when clients connects or
    //disconnects from your server
    server.addConEventListeners([](ClientInfo *client, CONN_EVENT event){
        if (event == CONN_EVENT::CONNECTED)
        {
            cout << "A client was connect in the server" << endl;
            client->addReceiveListener_s([](ClientInfo* clientp2, string data){
                cout << "Received from client the data: " << data << endl;
                clientp2->sendString("Ok, I received your data");

                //you can disconnect the client
                clientp2->disconnect();
            });
        }
        else
            cout << "A client was disconnect in the server" << endl;
    });
}
```
